This is what I would consider a good all-rounder config. Nothing too crazy, but still very functional.

I predominately use it to do web development using HTML, CSS, JS, and Python; in addition, I also use
it to write a lot of Lua when I want to procrastinate and work on the config some more.

I know that this is by no means the best or most original Neovim configuration of all time, but its
what works for me and the way I work and that's what matters.
